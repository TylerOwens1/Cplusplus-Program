# Cplusplus-Program
SNHU CS210 Coursework

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. TheZoo was a project I completed in C++ course to demonstate ablity to create data structures in C++ and intagrate java code into a C++ program. I created a POC for a system of storing information of zoo animals using a tracking ID.

I used C++ well and made clear and easy objects that would be easy to expand, the error checking in C++ also does a good job of validating data.

I could have used java to do more file reading and wirting, it would make for cleaner code than the C++ for file input/output

Writing the data validation was challanging but I was able to create it by just creating and testing one piece at a time

I definity fell more concreate in my OOP concepts and think I will be able to more effectivly use OOP in the future.

This program makes it easy to create new animal classes, as each indivdual animal only requires a few lines of code.
