SNHU CS300 Coursework

  -What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The pojects in this couse were trying to create data structures that could effectivle use and mutate lists of items. The time and space complexity had to be considered when looking at the diffrent data structures.

  -How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
 I had to use my knowlage gained on the time and space cost of the data structures in order to create and understand the cost of using them. Considering data sturtures for diffrent problems is important buecase their are diffrent positives and negitives to diffrent data structures.

  -How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
If i was ever having trouble solving a bug, I usually walked away or worked on other the tings for a little and come back to the problem wiht a fresh set of eyes. Even talking outloud to myself helped me work through problems I was having.

  -How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
For these pojects I wrote and thougt about he possible data structures I could use to store the data. Even thouth the dataset we have is small and using an inefficent data structure could be suffesient, I foud one that would be effecient even as the data grew in its size and complexity.

  -How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I have written other binany trees before so I think this project has helped me refine and practices makeing more readable and well thought out code. Conisdering different data structures for code allows me to become smarter about my futrure cohices reguarding diffrent data structures.
